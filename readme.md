# TREX-SMA
## Introduction
Welcome to TREX-SMA -- a distributed modeling engine for continuous simulation.

This repository builds on work initially developed as part of [James Halgren's
dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/docview/1288898538/).

## Testing
The code can be built and tested as follows:
```
cd JSHPhD/Code/sma2
make
cd -
cd JSHPhD/ExampleRuns/cg200607
../../Code/bin/sma2_gcc SMA.inp
```
